# Microsoft-Excel-Project

This is the Microsoft Excel Bike Sales Project. I followed the Video Series of @AlextheAnalyst on youtube while developing this project. This Project Includes the techniques of Data Cleaning, use of Pivot Table to take deep dive into data. Charts and then Dashboard is also developed to take a meaningfull insight. Please Download the file and take a deep dive into the project. One more thing to include here, i did not use Slicer Tool to breakdown the visuals further more, and the reason behind it is, i am using Microsoft Excel 2007 which does not support Slicer Feature.
Thanks.
